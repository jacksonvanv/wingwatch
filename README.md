## Update 9/5
Wing Watch is now a fully fledged flight tracker! Users can see delays, cancellations, and statuses for all flights between two airports. There has also been some design updates on the results page. I am in contact with my API support, as some airlines are currently missing (SAS, Singapore, and Japan Airlines).

## Release Background

Wing Watch shows all flights currently live and en-route between two airports. Users search by route, choosing origin and destination cities. Aviation enthusiasts often want to track live flights in the air between specific points. Existing flight tracking platforms tend to lack user-friendly interfaces and generally require knowledge of a specific flight number. I've observed some interesting information on route popularity and have used Wing Watch to monitor my friends' landing times before picking them up from the airport.

## Features

Some key features I'm especially proud of building include:
1. Adaptive, search-type dropdowns
2. Using the AirLabs API to make requests and then display response information on the webpage
3. Visually appealing UI
4. Responsive to different window sizes on a computer

Ongoing feature enhancements include:
1. See delayed, future, and cancelled flights (September 2023) **DONE!**
2. Search by airline and flight number (September 2023)
3. Use arrows and tabs to select (September 2023)
4. Filter and sort results by airline or time of day (October 2023)
5. Map view of current flights (October 2023)
6. Mobile (November 2023)
