# Wing Watch

Wing Watch shows all flights currently live between two airports. Users search by route, choosing origin and destination cities. When checking status, the user will see airline and airport information for those live flights.

When choosing what feature to include in a V1, I bounced back and forth between this live view of flights and a standard flight tracker, which would show delays and cancellations.

Aviation enthusiasts often want to track live flights in the air between specific origin and destination points. Existing flight tracking platforms sometimes provide this information, but they tend to lack user-friendly interfaces and generally require knowledge of a specific flight number. Wing Watch allows users to input their desired origin and destination, and in return, the platform displays real-time information about flights currently in the air between those points. I've observed some interesting information on route popularity and have used Wing Watch to monitor my friends' landing times before picking them up from the airport.

Some key features I'm especially proud of building include:
1. Adaptive, search-type dropdowns
2. Using the AirLabs API to make requests and then display response information on the webpage
3. Visually appealing UI
4. Responsive to different window sizes on a computer

Ongoing feature enhancements include:
1. Search by airline and flight number (September 2023)
2. See delayed, future, and cancelled flights (September 2023)
3. Use arrows and tabs to select (September 2023)
4. Filter and sort results by airline or time (October 2023)
5. Map view of current flights (October 2023)
6. Mobile (November 2023)
