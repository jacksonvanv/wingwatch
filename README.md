# Wing Watch
Website hosted here: https://jacksonvanv.github.io/wingwatch/

As of 9/6, Wing Watch is a fully fledged flight tracker! Users can search by route or by airline and flight number. The original version only showed live flights, but users can now see scheduled, delayed, and cancelled ones, too. This makes the site more broadly usable by anyone who needs real-time flight information.

## Release 8/24

Wing Watch shows all flights currently live and en-route between two airports. Users search by route, choosing origin and destination cities. Existing flight tracking platforms tend to lack user-friendly interfaces and generally require knowledge of a specific flight number. Wing Watch gives a comprehensive list of all flights on a route.

Aviation enthusiasts often want to track live flights in the air to observe landing times and locations. I've observed some interesting information on route popularity and have used Wing Watch to monitor my friends' landing times before picking them up from the airport.
